0.9.4
  * INCOMPATIBLE change to negentropy sync protocol!
    - Necessary because the protocol had an unfixable issue when syncing a very large DB
      into a small DB while using frameSizeLimit (sorry!)
  * If a client disconnects before its pending EVENT write messages have been processed,
    drop those messages instead of trying to write them
  * Bulk export commands now exit gracefully on a SIGPIPE
  * Fixed a race condition when sync command exits
  * Some optimisations in sync and export
  * noReadAhead config option: can reduce IO usage on instances where DB size > memory
  * Close the LMDB map file when execing plugins (works around LMDB bug)

0.9.3
  * Limit on events that can be processed by a sync
    - Configurable with relay.negentropy.maxSyncEvents
  * Warn when NIP-11 pubkey is in incorrect format (#52)
  * Bugfix: Setting rejectEphemeralEventsOlderThanSeconds larger than ephemeralEventsLifetimeSeconds did
    not work because events were then considered expired
  * Config parameter to silence "Rejected invalid event" logs: relay.logging.invalidEvents
  * Detect overflows when rejectEvents* config params are set very large
