0.9.7
  * `--fried` support from 1.0.0 was back-ported, allowing export of DBs
    in a fried format for efficient import by 1.0.0+ relays.
  * Bugfix: The cron thread was incorrectly removing expireable events prior
    to their expiry. Reported and fixed by KoalaSat.
  * A `limitation` entry is now included in the NIP-11 output. This exposes
    configured relay limits such as max message size. Added by Alex Gleason.
  * Node info support added: The relay now replies to requests to /nodeinfo/2.1
    and /.well-known/nodeinfo . Added by Alex Gleason.
  * NIP-70 support: Events with a "_" tag are considered protected and relays
    should only allow them to be posted by their author. Since strfry does
    not yet support AUTH, these events are always rejected. Added by fiatjaf.
  * NIP-11 icon support added by zappityzap.
  * Preliminary FreeBSD support added by cosmicpsyop.
  * Switch import to use WriterPipeline, allowing strfry import be used as a
    general-purpose non-relay event ingester. To do so, users must ensure that
    the stdout of their process they pipe into import is line buffered.

0.9.6
  * Bugfix: Sometimes malformed or old-format negentropy messages would throw
    uncaught exceptions which would cause the relay to crash. Now it properly
    handles and reports this situation in both logs and to the other side
    of the protocol.
  * New config option: relay.negentropy.enabled. Default is true. Set this to
    false if you wish to entirely stop the relay from handling negentropy messages.

0.9.5
  * New feature: strfry router!
  * INCOMPATIBLE change: The "lookbehind" feature of plugins was removed
  * INCOMPATIBLE change to negentropy sync protocol! (again)
    - The fingerprint function has now been changed to SHA-256, to protect the
      integrity of the sync mechanism in the presence of adversarial event creators
    - Going forward, the protocol now has mechanisms for backwards/forwards compatibility
  * Bugfix: Prevent a crash when a non-indexOnly scan was paused and then one of the
    buffered levIds was deleted or replaced before the scan resumed
  * Plugins can now be specified as shell commands, so you can pass command-line switches
    to them, set environment variables, use pipes/redirects, etc.
  * Plugins now propagate the environment variables of the strfry process to the
    plugin processes
  * Now if you don't return a "msg" (or return an empty string), it will no longer
    pollute your logs with "blocked event" messages

0.9.4
  * INCOMPATIBLE change to negentropy sync protocol!
    - Necessary because the protocol had an unfixable issue when syncing a very large DB
      into a small DB while using frameSizeLimit (sorry!)
  * If a client disconnects before its pending EVENT write messages have been processed,
    drop those messages instead of trying to write them
  * Bulk export commands now exit gracefully on a SIGPIPE
  * Fixed a race condition when sync command exits
  * Some optimisations in sync and export
  * noReadAhead config option: can reduce IO usage on instances where DB size > memory
  * Close the LMDB map file when execing plugins (works around LMDB bug)

0.9.3
  * Limit on events that can be processed by a sync
    - Configurable with relay.negentropy.maxSyncEvents
  * Warn when NIP-11 pubkey is in incorrect format (#52)
  * Bugfix: Setting rejectEphemeralEventsOlderThanSeconds larger than ephemeralEventsLifetimeSeconds did
    not work because events were then considered expired
  * Config parameter to silence "Rejected invalid event" logs: relay.logging.invalidEvents
  * Detect overflows when rejectEvents* config params are set very large
